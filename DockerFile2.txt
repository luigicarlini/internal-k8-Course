1. First, make sure you are in the custom-docker-image directory created in 
Exercise 2.01: Creating Our First Dockerfile. Confirm that the directory contains 
the following Dockerfile created in Exercise 2.01: Creating Our First Dockerfile:

# This is my first Docker image
FROM ubuntu 
LABEL maintainer=sathsara@mydomain.com 
RUN apt-get update
CMD ["The Docker Workshop"]
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "You are reading"]


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Build the Docker image with the docker image build command. This 
command has the optional -t flag to specify the tag of the image. Tag your 
image as welcome:1.0:
$ docker image build -t welcome:1.0 .

Do not forget the dot (.) at the end of the preceding command, which is 
used to denote the current directory as the build context.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Build this image again without changing the Dockerfile content:
$ docker image build -t welcome:2.0 .

Note that this build process completed much quicker than the previous process 
due to the cache being used:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Use the docker image list command to list all the Docker images available 
on your computer:

$ docker image list

These images are available on your computer, either when you pull them from a 
Docker registry, or when you build on your computer:

REPOSITORY TAG    IMAGE ID     CREATED        SIZE
welcome    1.0    98f571a42e5c 23 minutes ago 91.9MB
welcome    2.0    98f571a42e5c 23 minutes ago 91.9MB
ubuntu     latest 549b9b86cb8d 2 weeks ago    64.2MB

As you can see from the preceding output, there are three Docker images 
available. The ubuntu image is pulled from the Docker Hub, and version (tag) 
1.0 and 2.0 of the welcome images are built on your computer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Execute the docker container run command to start a new container 
from the Docker image that you built in step 1 (welcome:1.0):
$ docker container run welcome:1.0

The output should be as follows:
You are reading The Docker Workshop
You receive the expected output of You are reading The Docker 
Workshop. You are reading is due to the parameter provided with 
the ENTRYPOINT directive, and The Docker Workshop comes from the 
parameter provided with the CMD directive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Finally, execute the docker container run command again, this time with 
command-line arguments:
$ docker container run welcome:1.0 "Docker Beginner's Guide"
You will get the output You are reading Docker Beginner's Guide
because of the command-line argument, Docker Beginner's Guide, and 
the You are reading argument provided in the ENTRYPOINT directive:
You are reading Docker Beginner's Guide
